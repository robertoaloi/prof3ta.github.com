  <div class="entry-content">Imagine that you&#8217;re using Emacs and you have a list of items that you would like to convert into a numbered list.

We&#8217;re going from:
<blockquote>first

second

third</blockquote>
To:
<blockquote>1. first

2. second

3. third</blockquote>
Obviously, there are many ways to achieve this, but one is to use <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Keyboard-Macro-Counter.html#Keyboard-Macro-Counter" target="_blank">the Emacs Keyboard Macro Counter</a>.
<div id="_mcePaste">
<ul>
	<li>Put the cursor one line ABOVE your list.</li>
	<li>Start a macro: `F3`</li>
	<li>Insert the counter value: `C-x C-k C-i`. A 0 will appear</li>
	<li>Insert the DOT and a space: `.`</li>
	<li>Move  the cursor to the next line</li>
	<li>Stop the macro: `F4`</li>
	<li>Select your list</li>
	<li>`M-x apply-macro-to-region-lines`</li>
	<li>You can delete the 0 you added on the top and enjoy :)</li>

In the past few days, you might have noticed lot of tweets and noise (or maybe melodies) on the web regarding Erlang and Italy. Since most of the discussions have been performed in Italian, let&#8217;s try to summarize here what has just happened.

Everything started from a mail from <a href="http://twitter.com/eolo999" target="_blank">@eolo</a> in the official <a href="http://www.erlang.org/cgi-bin/ezmlm-cgi/4" target="_blank">erlang-questions mailing list</a>, proposing the creation of the first Italian Erlang User Group. A couple of members of the mailing list immediately pointed out that an Erlang User Group <a href="http://www.ossblog.it/post/4275/nasce-il-primo-erlang-user-group-in-italia" target="_blank">has already been created in Italy a couple of years ago</a>.

Well, apparently that simple mail was enough to awake that old group from his sleeping phase. Lot of new members are joining the group, that counts more than 40 members right now.

Rumors about an Erlang interest reached the careful ears of <a href="http://www.erlang-solutions.com" target="_blank">Erlang Solutions Ltd.</a>, a UK based Erlang company, that showed a great interest in boosting an Erlang User Group in Italy.

In a couple of days, all these discussions have been translated into a concrete proposal: an <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/erlang-etna/browse_thread/thread/8814211ae88ac1ed" target="_blank">Erlang Factory Lite in Rome</a>. Essentially, an Erlang Factory Lite consists in a sequence of talks regarding Erlang, followed by a so-called &#8220;erlounge&#8221;, an informal meeting having place in a pub or similar to allow people to meet each other and to discuss their Erlang experiences.

A successful Erlang Factory Lite had place, for example, <a href="http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/Krakow2009" target="_blank">past November in Krakow</a>.

To grant a free event, we&#8217;re currently looking at sponsors and at a venue, able to guest from 50 to 100 people. We&#8217;re doing our best to find some special &#8220;speaker&#8221;, too.

Together with the event, an Erlang course could be delivered by Erlang Solutions Ltd. at a special price, so whoever would be interested in this, feel free to contact me or directly the company.

It seems Erlang is finally meeting Italy and God only knows what is going to happen :)

In the meantime, stay tuned on Twitter. The tag to follow is #erlangit.

<time datetime="2010-03-06T00:00:00+01:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Mar 6<span>th</span>, 2010</time>

  <div class="entry-content">This seems to be one of the biggest political problems, nowadays. I&#8217;ll try to provide you an effective strategy on how to defeat your worst enemy in ages.
<h2>Berlusconi is not a dictator</h2>
We should be quite clear here. Especially abroad, people believe Berlusconi is governing Italy without having Italian consensus. This is just a wrong assumption and, as in mathematics, if you start from a wrong assumption, you&#8217;ll end wrong. So, for a moment, assume Italian people properly voted him, take a deep breath and reflect on why this could ever happen. An hint will follow very shortly.
<h2>A missing alternative</h2>
I&#8217;ll ask you again, after this heading. Why people is voting Berlusconi? Because they have no alternative. And it&#8217;s not just because of an extreme power on the media that makes impossible for opponents to show them up.

Seriously, there&#8217;s no one on the left party that could even remotely aim to the government in Italy. Italians are perfectly aware of this. They are aware of the fact that, even if they vote for the left party, they&#8217;ll be so disunited that they could never create a stable majority. They would be fighting each other and new elections would be needed in a few months.

If I ask you (and I&#8217;m looking at you, UK people) a name of someone from the left party, a candidate, their programme, would you be able to provide me with a name? How many of you know about <a href="http://www.beppegrillo.it/english.php" target="_blank">Beppe Grillo</a> and his political programme?
<h2>The wrong approach</h2>
One of the biggest errors in fighting Berlusconi regards strategy. Opponents usually reason in the following way:
<ol>
	<li>Get rid of Berlusconi</li>
	<li>Find an alternative</li>
</ol>
What I suggest, instead, is:
<ol>
	<li>Find an alternative</li>
	<li>Get rid of Berlusconi</li>
</ol>
<h2>It&#8217;s not a Media battle</h2>
It&#8217;s literally evident what a great communicator Berlusconi is. His power in the media world is just scaring.

Now, reflect. If you were in a war and you&#8217;d know your opponent is extremely skilled in a certain type of fight (say he&#8217;s got the best archers in the world), would you try to beat him by sending your archers against his own archers? Honestly, it wouldn&#8217;t make any sense.

You&#8217;ll never obtain anything attacking him on the media. You need a different strategy.
<h2>Be objective, don&#8217;t blame him for everything</h2>
Articles like <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/leading_article/article6401859.ece" target="_blank">this</a> one have the opposite effect on the Italian population. Treat Berlusconi in an objective way. Don&#8217;t publicly attack him on literally everything. If something wrong happens, the press immediately blames Berlusconi. You&#8217;ll just make him look as a victim, and, trust me, you&#8217;ll loose credibility and professionalism. If he&#8217;s doing something good, talk about it, don&#8217;t ignore it.
<h2>Do not compare Berlusconi with Mussolini</h2>
Berlusconi has nothing to do with Benito Mussolini. If you compare him with the dictator, you&#8217;ll help him in winning consensus. I know this sounds weird, but, for example, in the South of Italy, some people have a deformed conception of Fascism. The problem is far from being trivial and a lot of historical education should be performed in this sense.

Even if it&#8217;s sounds awkward, you need to understand how people were living in the South during Fascism. Lot of burglaries and killings, chaos and disorder were having place before the dictator. During that period, people were living under a surface of  safe condition. Lot of roads and sewers and land reclamations have been performed. The Italian football team won two world cups. If you talk to an old grandfather you&#8217;ll hear sentences like: &#8220;Today, I&#8217;m not feeling safe. When Mussolini was governing, I could sleep with my front door open&#8221;.

You need to understand and educate these people. In the meantime, clarify that Berlusconi is not Mussolini. Don&#8217;t merge the two personalities, and you&#8217;ll gain consensus among this category of people (that is luckily not the majority, nut still they represent a good number in some areas).
<h2>Don&#8217;t talk about his private life</h2>
Berlusconi is not an actor. People shouldn&#8217;t care about his love affairs, he&#8217;s not Tiger Woods. Treat him as an actor and he&#8217;ll win consensus (actors will always have popularity, no matter if they&#8217;re good or bad behaving). Treat him as a politician and you&#8217;ll win. A Cornwell&#8217;s style <em>Gotham Gotcha</em> gossip column won&#8217;t help you in beating him.
<h2>Be informed</h2>
There are so many errors and imprecisions when foreign press is reporting news from Italy. Guys, if you want to gain consensus, be informed, send people there to check what&#8217;s really going on. Don&#8217;t trust rumors. Talk to Italian people, they&#8217;re better than you think.
<h2>Don&#8217;t focus on him, but on his co-workers</h2>
Berlusconi has a great personality. Doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s a good one or a bad one. He&#8217;s simply too strong (because of media, because of money, whatever you want). But he&#8217;s not governing Italy by himself. He&#8217;s surrounded by low-profile people, easily attackable. Focus on the <a href="http://www.leganord.org/" target="_blank">Lega Nord</a>, focus on people is selecting for decisive roles. Unmount these people, one by one. Carefully look at their political programme. You&#8217;ll find incredible things, extremely easy to attack.

  <div class="entry-content">Recently, Google released a new Beta version of its browser Chrome.

Well, my installed version of Chrome didn&#8217;t detect automatically the update, so I downloaded the latest version from:

<a href="http://www.google.com/landing/chrome/beta/" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/landing/chrome/beta/</a>

Then, when I tried to drag and drop the application into the <em>Applications</em> folder (this will require you to quit from Chrome, if open), Snow Leopard complained about:

<blockquote>The operation can’t be completed because you don’t have permission to access some of the items.</blockquote>

Well, just open the <em>Applications</em> folder in <em>Finder</em>. <strong>Move to Trash</strong> the old Google Chrome application (it will prompt you with the Admin password). Then, drag and drop the new Chrome on it.

Now, you can enjoy your new Google Chrome Beta version and its extensions.

  <div class="entry-content"><h3 id="what-is-highcharts-php">What is highcharts-php</h3>
highcharts-php is a PHP library to interact with the <a href="http://www.highcharts.com/">Highcharts JS charting library</a>.
<h3 id="what-is-highcharts">What is Highcharts</h3>
Reading from the official documentation, &#8220;Highcharts is a charting library written in pure JavaScript, offering an easy way of adding interactive charts to your web site or web application&#8221;.

The Highcharts JS libraries are available at: www.highcharts.com and they are free for non commercial use. For commercial usage, please refers to the license and pricing section of their website.
<h3 id="are-the-highcharts-and-highcharts-php-projects-related">Are the Highcharts and highcharts-php projects related?</h3>
Again, the highcharts-php project has nothing to do with the Highcharts projects. The authors are different and the two projects don&#8217;t share any single line of code.
<h3 id="why-highcharts-php">Why highcharts-php</h3>
The reason behind the highcharts-php project is to offer a useful tool to PHP developers to automatically generate Highcharts JS code starting from some PHP data.

The <strong>highcharts-php </strong>library is available for free download, as usual, at my software page:

  <div class="entry-content">I always find <strong>flymake </strong>extremely useful when editing code in Emacs.

In this period, I&#8217;m working a bit with PHP and I&#8217;ve immediately thought that enabling flymake for Emacs was indeed a good idea.

Well, <a href="http://twitter.com/sachac" target="_blank">someone</a> has apparently already thought about it, so everything you need to know about it is explained <a href="http://sachachua.com/wp/2008/07/emacs-and-php-on-the-fly-syntax-checking-with-flymake/" target="_blank">here</a>.

I tried it on my machine and it worked like a charm. Combined with some <a href="http://aloiroberto.wordpress.com/2009/12/09/php-and-emacs-how-to-browse-documentation/" target="_blank">PHP documentation integrated in Emacs</a>, I&#8217;m now starting to have a complete and powerful development environment for PHP.

I&#8217;m now wondering if there&#8217;s any way to get this a step forward. First of all, I&#8217;m trying to identify <em>errors</em> different from the parsing ones. What I would really love, for example, is to have Emacs showing me all the <strong>unused variables</strong> in a PHP file. If you have any idea on how to achieve this, don&#8217;t be shy and share your thoughts with me, as a post comment or, if you prefer, as a private e-mail or through <a href="http://twitter.com/prof3ta" target="_blank">twitter</a>.

I registered this blog almost one year ago (even if I started adding posts to it in a more constant way just in August).

Now that one year is passed, it&#8217;s time to view at the statistics. I passed from 0 to <strong>2.270 visits per month</strong>. It&#8217;s not a lot, but it is still something. Currently, I have more than <strong>100 unique visits</strong> per day to the blog.

I hope you find the blog and its posts interesting.
